# Melbourne_property_market_2016_2018

The domain I have chosen for the  visualization is the Melbourne Property Price from 2016 to 2018.

Melbourneâ€™s property market soared from 2016 to 2017 and seen a decline from then. It would be interesting to see whether the trend was unanimous across all the regions of Melbourne. Besides, we can look at the suburb which had the highest growth from 2016. Also, it would be interesting to see the most expensive suburbs in Melbourne.  

The visualisation is intended to show the average Australian who would like to see the trend in Melbourne Property market.  

The dataset  I have obtained here for the analysis is from Kaggle uploaded by the author Tony Pino(URL: https://www.kaggle.com/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market). It is the dataset of Melbourne Property Price from 2016 to 2018 which the author obtained from the Domain.com.au website. I have looked at different data sources for the property market and finally found this one  in Kaggle.
