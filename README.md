# Melbourne_property_market_2016_2018

The domain I have chosen for the  visualization is the Melbourne Property Price from 2016 to 2018.

Melbourne’s property market soared from 2016 to 2017 and seen a decline from then. It would be interesting to see whether the trend was unanimous across all the regions of Melbourne. Besides, we can look at the suburb which had the highest growth from 2016. Also, it would be interesting to see the most expensive suburbs in Melbourne.  

The visualisation is intended to show the average Australian who would like to see the trend in Melbourne Property market.  

The dataset  I have obtained here for the analysis is from Kaggle uploaded by the author Tony Pino(URL: https://www.kaggle.com/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market). It is the dataset of Melbourne Property Price from 2016 to 2018 which the author obtained from the Domain.com.au website. I have looked at different data sources for the property market and finally found this one  in Kaggle.

I have designed the layout for the dashboard as a partitioned poster with the careful use of minimum sightlines to reduce the disjointedness and to enhance the layout. The dashboard has a symmetric distribution and proper alignment of charts to enhance the visual appealing. I have used the tool tip for each visualisation to boost the interactivity. I have also left a fair amount of white space to enhance the visual appealing of the dashboard.
In terms of typeface, I have used the san serif font all across the graph to enhance the readability. Further, I have used different size for the heading and subheadings and used bold font to highlight the important information. In addition I have also used the dark blue colour for the text to match the entire visualisation.

Southern metropolitan , the most expensive region on all three years , has shown a steady increase in median price.

The stacked bar chart helps us to easily identify the proportion of different property composition across all regions.

The annotation used in the Southern Metropolitan region helps us to identify the peculiarity in its property composition. In addition , colour hue has used here to highlight the categorical data.
